# agy-chat

A work-chat client for [agy-team](https://github.com/roelle/agy-team): you and
your agents in shared channels and threads, with the team's live state beside
the conversation.

## Run it

```bash
pip install "agy-chat @ git+https://github.com/roelle/agy-chat.git@v0.9.0"
agy-chat --author <your name>
```

That installs agy-team's core with it (standard library only). From a
checkout, to hack on it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roelle/agy-chat.git && cd agy-chat
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e ../agy-team      # optional: use your own agy-team checkout
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/python -m agychat --author <your name>
```

It lists every team under `~/agy-teams` (or `--teams-root DIR`, or
`--team-dir PATH`, repeatable) and prints a URL with a one-time token. Open
that URL (or pass `--open` and it opens it for you; `--no-open` is the
default); the browser keeps the token as a cookie. `--host ADDR` and
`--port N` choose where it listens.

**Start team** launches `python -m agyteam.supervisor --daemon` for the team.
The runner and manager are the team's own when its roster has a
[`supervisor` block](https://github.com/roelle/agy-team#how-a-team-is-run-the-rosters-supervisor-block)
(`runner`, `runner_config`, `manager`); otherwise the runner is whatever your
environment configures (`AGYTEAM_RUNNER`; the default is the `agy` CLI, which
needs nothing more) and the manager is detected from roles. The status pill
shows the runner and manager the supervisor is using; hover it to see where
each came from. It uses `AGYTEAM_PYTHON`
if set, else the virtualenv of an agy-team checkout it was installed from,
else its own interpreter -- so to run teams on the SDK runner, install
`agyteam[sdk]` into the same environment or point `AGYTEAM_PYTHON` at one
that has it. **Stop** writes the team's `.stop`, which cancels the turns in
flight; their mail is delivered again on Start. **Restart** keeps them: the
supervisor starts no new turns, lets the ones in flight finish (the pill says
whom it is waiting for), then restarts itself on the installed code.

## One app: Chat, Board, Wiki, Admin

Every page has the same bar across the top: **Chat**, **Board**, **Wiki**
and **Admin**, for the team you have picked, and ⚙ for your preferences
(time zone, clock, go links).

## Admin

The **Admin** page has four tabs:

- **Agents**: set an agent's picture (and yours), change its role, default
  model, memory model (for its
  distill, review and retro turns), principal flag, tools
  it may not call and aliases; add an agent (it joins every channel unless
  you untick that) or remove one. Changes go through agy-team's roster
  history, so a running supervisor adopts them instead of putting them back.
- **Norms**: edit `NORMS.md`. Agents read it when a conversation starts.
  **Lessons in common** lists lessons three or more agents learned
  separately, as candidates for a norm. **Draft** puts one in the editor for
  you to rewrite; nothing is saved until you save.
- **Memories**: each agent's memories with their history: how long each has
  been known, how often it was rewritten, how often the agent read it back.
  Sort by least read or oldest, or show only those never read. Write and
  delete memories, restore from the archive anything deleted or merged away,
  see recent memory reviews, and **Review now** to queue one. A review is a
  turn in which the agent merges, rewrites and deletes its own memories. It
  also runs on its own at milestones and weekly, between the agent's turns.
- **Update & restart**: the versions running, a check for updates, a
  Restart per team, and **Update & restart everything**. That updates
  agy-team and agy-chat where they are installed (a checkout fast-forwards,
  a pip install moves to the newest release), restarts every running team
  gracefully, then restarts agy-chat in place; the page reloads itself and
  stays signed in. The same from a terminal: `python -m agychat.update`
  (it does not restart the app), or `python -m agyteam.update` for agy-team
  alone.

New channels include **every agent, including ones added later**, unless you
untick that and pick some.

## How it behaves

- **Channels are pull, mentions are push.** Posting to a channel wakes only
  the agents you mention: `@coder`, `@here` (everyone in the channel), `@all`
  (the whole team). Everyone else in the channel gets the post as unread mail
  that does not wake them; when they are next woken for anything, they read
  all of it. A busy channel costs no turns.
- **Direct messages wake.** A message to one agent was addressed to it.
- **Threads.** Every message has an id; "reply in thread" opens the thread in
  the right-hand drawer, and agents reply in threads with `thread=<id>`.
- **What is surfaced.** Deliverables, questions, blockers and reviews are
  marked; acks, fyi and status notes are collapsed into one line ("3 quiet
  updates") unless you tick *quiet updates*. Supervisor plumbing is left out
  of the stream; its notices to you (escalations, budget halts, allowance
  warnings) are under **notices**.
- **Agent-to-agent conversations** are listed under *Between agents*,
  read-only, so you can watch a delegation or a review round directly.
- **What becomes a link.** Web addresses; go links (`go/name`, sent to the
  go-link address in ⚙ Preferences, `http://go/` by default); `#channel`
  (opens it); `@name` (shown by the agent's alias, and resolved as agy-team
  resolves it); task ids (shown as the task's title, linked to the board);
  file paths, absolute, `~/`, or relative to the team's folders.
- **Markdown**: headings, lists and checklists, tables, quotes, code, links
  and images.
- **Times** are shown in full, as day, date, time and zone, in your time
  zone and 12- or 24-hour clock (⚙ Preferences, kept in this browser).
- **Pictures and files.** Paste or drop a picture into the message box, or
  use 📎. The file is kept in the team's `attachments/` folder and the
  message carries its path, so agents can open it; pictures are shown in the
  message.
- **Artifacts.** File paths in messages become pills; clicking one opens it
  in the side panel, read-only: markdown rendered (or Raw), pictures shown,
  diffs coloured, directories listed. Anything in the team's own tree, its
  roster workspaces or the shared directory can be opened, and anything in
  your home directory that is not hidden.
- **A channel's tasks** sit at the top of it, open ones first, with their
  owners; **Panel ▸ → Tasks** lists them all, closed ones too, with the
  tokens spent on each. A busy channel can drop them from the top and keep
  them in the panel.
- **Bookmarks** on a channel (links, go links, paths) sit under its name.
- **Emoji**: 😀 in the message box, or type `:` and a name (`:rocket:`), or
  your system's picker.
- **On the board**, each card shows the tokens spent on it, and a task's
  detail has the breakdown by agent and its links (web addresses, go links,
  paths).
- **Live operations.** Each agent's state (working, idle, failing, offline)
  and model sit in the lower left. Click an agent for its recent turns, tool
  calls and failures; click its model to move it to another one, optionally
  until a time (applied by the supervisor at the agent's next idle moment:
  it distills, then starts a fresh conversation). Tasks are grouped by
  status, with review state and reminders.
- **The board** (Tasks → *Board ↗*, or `/board`) is a Kanban of the team's
  tasks: Icebox, To do, In progress, Blocked, Review and Done, with failed
  and cancelled behind a toggle.
  - Drag a card to change its status, its order, and, in swimlanes by owner
    or project, its owner or project. The owner is told.
  - A card opens its full story: every change in its log, the messages
    tagged with it, and its reviews.
  - Closing a card that needs a review asks you to waive it, on the record.
  - Filter by owner, project or text.
- **Chat and board link to each other.**
  - A channel's header lists the tasks discussed in it, and **+ Task** makes
    one linked to the channel.
  - Any message can be *made a task*.
  - A card's `#channel` opens that channel, and *Message* opens a DM with
    its owner.
  - Links are plain URLs (`/board?team=T#task=ID`, `/?team=T#channel=C`), so
    each page keeps its own tab.
- **Channels** can be archived (read-only, out of the agents' lists) or
  deleted (also hidden here; the messages stay in the team's record), and
  restored from *Archived* in the sidebar.
- **Names.** Agents show by their roster `alias` (`Ada` for `at-Ada`), and
  `@` autocomplete inserts it. Set the roster's `operator` and agents know you
  as `@Matt`. Their mentions of you are highlighted and flagged with an `@`
  on the channel.
- **Panes resize**: drag the edges of the sidebar and the drawer, and the
  divider inside the sidebar. A double-click resets one.
- **Search** (⌘K / Ctrl+K) covers messages, tasks and the team's norms.
- **Team wiki** opens the team's `NORMS.md` and every agent's saved memories
  in a new tab.

## Decisions made for v1

| question | v1 answer |
|---|---|
| Do unmentioned channel posts wake a lead agent? | No. Only mentions wake; everyone reads the channel on their next wake. |
| Can you comment on an artifact? | Not inline. The pane is read-only; quote lines in a thread reply. |
| One operator or several? | One. Every message you send carries your name (`author`), so several later is a UI change, not a data migration. |
| Same app as agy-team? | No: a separate app over agy-team's public client API (`agyteam.record`, `agyteam.actions`). It never reads or writes the team's files itself. |
| The board: same app or another? | Same app, its own page. It shares the server, the token, the live feed and the team picker, and links to the chat by URL. The task store and actions are agy-team's, so another client (or a sync to an external tracker) can be built on them later. |
| Delete a channel for real? | No. Delete archives it and hides it here; its messages stay in `bus.jsonl`, the team's record. Restore brings it back. |

## Security

The server binds to 127.0.0.1 unless you pass `--host`. It refuses any
request whose `Host` header names something it was not told to answer to,
which stops DNS rebinding. Loopback names always pass, and so does the name
given to `--host`. Bound beyond loopback, so does any IP literal. It
requires the token on every API call, and accepts changes only as JSON with
a `SameSite=Strict` cookie, so a web page you happen to have open cannot
post as you. It can do anything the operator can, which is a lot on a team
of agents with shells. Beyond loopback it is plain HTTP, so anyone who can
reach it and has the URL is you: put it behind something that adds TLS and
authentication, or keep it on loopback and tunnel to it.

## Limits

- Unread markers are per browser (local storage), not shared.
- Search is substring search over the record, not an index.
- A team's runner and policy fields (workspaces, path rules) are set in its
  roster file, not in the app.
- Update refuses a checkout with local changes rather than overwrite them.
- No desktop notifications; the tab title gets a dot when an agent writes to
  you.

## Tests

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Starts the real server on a spare port against a temporary team and drives
it over HTTP: the token and Host checks, mention-only waking, threads, DMs,
channels, models, artifact confinement, the live feed, search and the wiki,
and the admin API: agents, norms, memories, everyone-channels, restart and
update.

## Versioning

Releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z` ([Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)),
with notes in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); before 1.0.0 a minor release may
break. Each release pins the agy-team release it was built against.
`agy-chat --version` prints both. To cut one: move the `[Unreleased]` notes
under a new version, set `__version__` in `agychat/__init__.py`, run the
tests, then `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "agy-chat X.Y.Z" && git push origin main vX.Y.Z`.
